# Creating a welcoming README

When you create your project, you may have a specific audience in mind (for
example, software developers or other researchers in your field)... but you can
reach a much broader community! Many people outside of your field-- designers,
technical writers, citizen scientists-- may be interested in your project and
have valuable contributions to offer! Clearly communicating information about
your project in simple language is an excellent way to grow and diversify your
community.

The readme file is one of the first things you add to your project repository.
It introduces your project idea and goals. Along with the contributing file,
the roadmap, and your Code of Conduct, the readme file helps welcome, orient,
and encourage newcomers to participate.

As we have seen GitHub gives a special role to the file named `README.md`. This
makes it very visible and hence a good place to welcome people to your project.

For a project that is only used within your lab (or even just by you) it is
still a good idea to list what the project does, how to install and use it. It
will help you in three months time (or after a holiday) and encourages others
to try out your project, and then they might contribute! The act of writing out
what the project does will also help you stay focussed when adding new things.

The following 3 easy steps are designed to help you create an effective readme file.

## Write a README

Write your README! If you'll need to cover the following points:

* Say hello! Welcome people to the project.
* Show what you're doing, for who, and why.
* Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting!
* Show how to get started using or contribution to the project
* State what resources and contributions you are looking for
* Point to other key resources, such as a contributing.md file and a roadmap.

Examples of READMEs that I like:
* [Working Open Workshop README](https://github.com/mozillascience/WOW-2017/blob/master/README.md)
* [scikit-learn README](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
* https://github.com/karan/joe

_Note: have you commited your changes?_

## Remove jargon

The US space team's [Up goer five](https://xkcd.com/1133/). Copy and paste
the description of your project into http://splasho.com/upgoer5/. How many
words do you have to remove?

_Exercise: can we describe "decentralised internet" without using words that
are too complicated?_

Try and re-write your project description so that it passes the "up goer five"
test. While you might not want to use that description in reality it will make
you aware of jargon and complex words that might be worth replacing.

In your final readme text, DON'T restrict yourself to only the most common
words--if you do, your project description may become overly simplified and
limited. Use what you've learned from this exercise to keep your readme as
jargon-free as possible. If you use jargon, be sure to define those words.


## Re-write your readme

Re-write your entire readme in clear language and define all terms. Share
your new README in your project repository.

Make sure to use Git along the way. Use `git add` to add a file you changed,
`git commit -m "My message here"` to record the changes, and `git push` to
store changes on GitHub.
